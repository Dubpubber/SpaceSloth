# Project Purpose
The purpose of Spacesloth is purely entertainment. The idea came from a good friend of mine who suggested the concept and I took the idea and ran with it. Now, Spacesloth is about five factions featuring five different animal species: The Bat Syndicate, The Bear Republic, The Octopi Cartel, The Penguin Platoon and of course, The Sloth Empire. These five factions race against each other in a humorous space race of conquer, trade and resource grab. 

As of right now, this game is inactive in terms of development.
